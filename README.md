# InputManager

## About
This repository provides a sample wrapper for Unityâ€™s Input System.  
It shows how to manage callbacks efficiently and access input values of the current frame from anywhere in your program.  

## Description
Automatically registers and unregisters callbacks to the Input System.  
To integrate your own custom inputs into this system, follow the approach shown in [InputManager.cs](https://github.com/foriver4725/InputManager/blob/main/Assets/foriver4725/InputManager/InputManager.cs).  
For how to receive and handle input, see [InputSample.cs](https://github.com/foriver4725/InputManager/blob/main/Assets/foriver4725/InputManager/InputSample.cs).  
The internal implementation can be found in [InputManagerImpl.cs](https://github.com/foriver4725/InputManager/blob/main/Assets/foriver4725/InputManager/InputManagerImpl.cs).  

## How to Download
Download the asset package from [the latest release](https://github.com/foriver4725/InputManager/releases) and import it into your project.
